# Java Education!

Projects:

- `java-education` is a collection of abstractions (for graphical or textual
  IO) meant to make learning Java more interesting.

- `java-edu-2017` has lesson summaries of our newbie education lessons for
  the 2016-17 year, and some example code which uses `java-education`.

- `workspacer` is an account system that the newbies can log in to on
  Guest sessions, and with which we can give them starter files, libraries,
  and software (like OpenCV).
