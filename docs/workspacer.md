# workspacer

Workspacer allows newbies to save their work at the end of meetings, (while on
Guest accounts), and allows us to give them class skeletons, documentation files
(without giving access to the internet) and such.

## Setting up this repo

To set up an instance of this project:

    $ touch round2/users.csv
    $ mkdir round2/their-work
    $ ln -s /path/to/repo/round2 ~/round2
    $ ln -s /path/to/repo/client2 ~/client2

And the necessary libraries must be in `~/workspace-libs` (jfxrt.jar and other amd files).
These exist on the `robotics` user account.

## Setting up machines in lab

`copy-docs-all.sh` will copy the Java SE 8 API docs to all machines in rm. 451
which do not have them (at `/var/tmp/javase8-api`).

    $ bash copy-docs-all.sh

`setup-all.sh` copies necessary libraries for JavaFX to the machines that do
not have them (at `/var/tmp/robo-libs`), and updates the necessary plaintext
files on all machines.

    $ bash setup-all.sh

Between meetings (preferably at the end of each meeting, for security's sake),
`make-ssh.sh` should be run:

    $ bash make-ssh.sh
    $ bash setup-all.sh

After running `make-ssh.sh`, `setup-all.sh` *must* be run
again in order for the students to work.
